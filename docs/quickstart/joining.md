# Joining a token-based DAO

The DAO we previously created was not a token based DAO. While you're
using DAO DAO you are likely to encounter DAOs that are token
based. This page walks through that process.

To join a token based DAO you must "register to vote" by staking your
governance tokens with the DAO. Once you are registered to vote you
can vote on all future proposals, but you cant go back and vote on
proposals that were created before you registered.

To register to vote, visit your DAO's page on DAO DAO and look in the
right sidebar:

From here you can press the "Stake tokens" button and a modal will
appear asking how many you'd like to stake:

By staking your tokens, you are registering those tokens for
voting. Any tokens you do not stake won't count towards your voting
power. If you want your votes to matter as much as possible, you'll
likely want to stake all of them.

There are some situations where you may not want to stake all of
your tokens. For example:

1. Some DAOs require that some tokens are deposited to create a
   proposal. If you plan on making a proposal, you may leave one
   deposit worth of tokens unstaked.
2. Some DAOs have an unstaking duration, defined as the amount of time
   you must wait after unstaking your tokens before those tokens are
   available to you. If you are holding tokens in a DAO with a
   non-zero staking duration, and you think you may want to sell or
   trade those tokens quickly in the future, you may consider leaving
   some tokens unstaked.
