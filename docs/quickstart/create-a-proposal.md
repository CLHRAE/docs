# Create your first proposal

After [creating a DAO for your bookclub](./create-a-dao),
I'm sure you're busy telling all of your friends to download Keplr so they can join you.

While you wait for them to join the wonderful world of the Cosmoverse, why don't we make a governance proposal for them when they get here? 

Let's create a proposal to decide what book to read. To begin, starting from your DAO's page, navigate to Proposals > Create.

## Create Proposal

Since you're the first one here, it's only fair that you suggest what everyone read next.

Let's create a proposal suggesting the group read Murray Bookchin's *The Next Revolution: Popular Assemblies and the Promise of Direct Democracy*.

> **Name**: Let's read Murray Bookchin - The Next Revolution
>
> **Description**: For our next book, let’s read Murray Bookchin’s [The Next Revolution: Popular Assemblies and the Promise of Direct Democracy](https://libcom.org/files/Murray%20Bookchin-The%20Next%20Revolution.%20Popular%20Assemblies%20and%20the%20Promise%20of%20Direct%20Democracy-Verso%20(2015).pdf).

### Proposal messages

Proposal messages are actions that execute when the proposal passes. These messages let you do things like *mint* new governance tokens, *spend* from the shared treasury, and more. 

:::danger TODO
Add separate documentation for each of the spend messages and link to it here.

The proposal we have here is more of a social contract. We don't need anything to change in code. 

### Create proposal

Now that we're ready, go ahead and press "Create proposal." Keplr will again ask you to approve the transaction. Once you approve it, you'll see your proposal is live!

## Voting

On your proposal's screen, you should now be able to vote yes or no.

Note that the proposal says "open." That means the proposal is open to voting. After the voting period passes (set in your DAO's [governance configuration](./create-a-dao.md#voting-config)), the governance proposal will pass or fail depending on whether it got

### Vote yes!

Go ahead and vote *yes* on your new proposal! Approve the transaction in Keplr and see your proposal pass.

:::tip
Why did your proposal pass? Because you have all the voting tokens! After the proposal reaches the [threshold you set earlier](./create-a-dao.md#voting-config), the proposal automatically passes.
