# Create your first proposal

After [creating a DAO for your bookclub](./create-a-dao),
I'm sure you're busy telling all of your friends to download Keplr so they can join you.
While you wait for them to join the wonderful world of the Cosmoverse, why don't we make a governance proposal for them when they get here? 

Let's create a proposal to decide what book to read. 

## Crafting your proposal

Since you're the first one here, it's only fair that you suggest what everyone read next.
Let's create a proposal suggesting the group read Murray Bookchin's *The Next Revolution: Popular Assemblies and the Promise of Direct Democracy*.

To begin, starting from your DAO's page, navigate to **Proposals > Create**.

:::tip Messages?
You'll notice the Messages tag there. [Proposal messages](/docs/proposal-messages#proposal-messages) allow you to add rich scripting capabilities to proposal messages&mdash;commands that execute on the chain when the proposal passes.

The proposal we have here is more of a social contract. We don't need anything to change in code.

## Ship it!


Now that we're ready, go ahead and press **Create proposal**. 
Keplr will again ask you to approve the transaction.

Once you approve it, you'll see your proposal is live!

Now that we've made a proposal, let's vote on it.
