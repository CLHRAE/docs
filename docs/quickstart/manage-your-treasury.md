# Manage your treasury

As your book club grows and flourishes, you'll likely want to manage its treasury.

## Your treasury

Navigate to your DAO's treasury and have a look at your token balances.
You should see your token balance lists the number of tokens you assigned to yourself.

But the treasury will have no tokens. Why don't we give our excess tokens to the treasury?

mint some tokens... put them in the treasuruy...

:::tip
Thanks to the magic of IBC, your DAO's treasury can even hold tokens beside your DAO's native governance tokens. Your DAO can hold ATOM, JUNO, STARS, or anything else that supports IBC!
