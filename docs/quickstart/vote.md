# Stake and vote on your proposal

The most important part of being in a DAO is voting on proposals. Let's learn how to do it!

Why did your proposal pass? Because you have all of the staked governance tokens! After the proposal reaches the [passing threshold](/docs/voting-config#passing-threshold-), the proposal automatically passes.
