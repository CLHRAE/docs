# Contribute to DAO DAO!

DAO DAO rewards the people who contribute to it. 

The first step is to join the community! We generally hangout in Discord ([invite link](https://discord.com/invite/sAaGuyW3D2), be sure to complete the verification process).

Anyone can contribute, and contributions are not limited to code. Design, bug reports, research, educational materials, translations, and being helpful to other users with questions are all contributions, and are eligible for rewards!

Want to get started? [Learn about our retroactive rewards program here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12WpREOPrvhW3YVxGLoOkrhTgf_bDUy4cn9VKeyH4PUY/edit).
