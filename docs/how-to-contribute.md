# Contributor guidelines

DAO DAO exists because of contributors! Initial $DAO tokens were distributed to these contributors. However, it was impossible to include everyone in the first drop. Going forward, we will periodically recognize more contributors and drop tokens to them!

This document describes how to contribute and be recognized for contributions.

## How to become a contributor?

First step is to join the community! We generally hangout in Discord ([invite link](https://discord.com/invite/sAaGuyW3D2), be sure to complete the verification process).

There are many ways to become contributor:

- Code
- Design
- QA and Bug Reporting
- Contributing clear, concise, and helpful documentation
- Educational materials (e.g. contributing to this repo!)
- Being a helpful community member
- Translations

Note that financial donations are not on this list. Contributions are donations of *labor* to make DAO DAO better at achieving its mission, including contributions that make the interchain stronger overall.

## How to get recognized

Each month, anyone who has contributed to the project in the past month will fill out a form detailing their contributions. Following this, the DAO DAO Development Fund (a group of core DAO DAO contributors) will review the responses and vote on token allocations for the contributions.

To prevent spam and unwanted DMs to DAO DAO members, we have one rule: **no asking for DAO tokens**.

We do not take proposals, but rather recognize work after it has been completed.

No need to ask permission to contribute, just do it!
