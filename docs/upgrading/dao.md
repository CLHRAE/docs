# Upgrading a DAO

To upgrade a beta DAO to a v1 DAO:

1. Create a new proposal.
2. Press the "Add Component +" button and select the "☯️ Upgrade to V1"
   template.

The template will then walk you through the steps to migrate to your
new V1 DAO. After you fill out the template, make sure to double check
that the new DAO is configured correctly.

A good way of testing that your new DAO is correct is to make a
new proposal in the new one called "Acceptance of V1 DAO". Then,
have members vote on the proposal. If everyone votes and the proposal
passes, its a good sign that your DAO is configured correctly.

## Why upgrade

By upgrading from beta to V1 you'll continue to receive new feature
releases from DAO DAO and start using
[audited](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
smart contracts.

The beta frontend and contracts will eventually be moved to
legacy.daodao.zone and stop receiving new feature releases.
