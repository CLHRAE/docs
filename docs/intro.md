# Introduction

DAO DAO provides tooling for building multichain DAOs with safe smart
contracting in Rust, powered by the [Cosmos
SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk) and [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/).

## Getting Started

To create a DAO or multisig in your browser, head to head to
[daodao.zone](https://daodao.zone) This web-based UI will help you start a DAO
on the [Juno](https://junochain.com/) chain. You'll just need [Keplr
wallet](https://wallet.keplr.app/) and the addresses of your comrades.

## Running your own chain (advanced)
