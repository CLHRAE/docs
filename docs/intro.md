# Introduction

Welcome to DAO DAO!

DAO DAO provides tooling for building multichain [DAOs](./quickstart/what-is-dao.md)
with smart contracting in Rust, powered by the [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk) and [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/).

## Getting started

DAO DAO's UI (hosted at [daodao.zone](https://daodao.zone/) will help you build
a DAO on the [Juno blockchain](https://junochain.com/).

To get started, head on to our [Quickstart](./quickstart/what-is-dao).

## Running your own chain (advanced)
