# Voting configuration

You can change the parameters of voting on your DAO in a variety of ways.

These parameters can be set when you create a DAO, and can be modified after the fact by [governance proposals](proposal-messages).

## Passing threshold (%)

This is the percentage of the DAO that must vote "yes" for a proposal to pass.

## Voting duration (seconds)

This is how long proposals remain open for voting

## Proposal deposit

This is how many tokens someone must put down to create a proposal.

## Unstaking duration

After someone stakes tokens in your DAO, those tokens cannot be immediately unstaked. The duration for which they remain bonded after intending to unstake is determined by the unstaking duration.
