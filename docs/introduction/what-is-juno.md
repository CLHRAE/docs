# What is Juno? CosmWasm?

DAO DAO is built on top of the [Juno chain](https://junochain.com/). Juno is a
permissionless blockchain network for deploying cross-chain smart contracts.

The smart contracts that power DAO DAO are deployed on Juno.

## What is CosmWasm?

Aside from what we've already mentioned, Juno's killer feature is its support of
[CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/).

CosmWasm is a [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) virtual machine that runs
in a [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.42/building-modules/intro.html)
module.

## Smart contracting in Rust

  * [ ] In practice, this technical stack allows us (DAO DAO) to build smart contracts
in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Rust is a performant, memory- and
thread-safe programming language with a rich type system.

Writing smart contracts in Rust allows us to do better security analysis on our
contracts, which in turn protects your DAOs from common attacks.
