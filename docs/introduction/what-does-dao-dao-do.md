# What does DAO DAO do?

DAO DAO is a tool for building DAOs in the Cosmoverse.
It allows you to build IBC-enable DAOs---that is, DAOs whose treasuries can hold any token on any blockchain, so long as the chain supports IBC.

DAO DAO
lets you write safe, testable smart
contracts in Rust
using 
[CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/).
By default, it deploys DAOs to the [Juno chain](https://junochain.com/).
For power users,
it lets you make self-sovereign chain for your DAO as well.


Best of all, governance tokens are IBC enabled (cw20-gov) tokens. You can trade
and swap your governance tokens wherever IBC allows.
