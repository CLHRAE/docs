# Welcome to DAO DAO!

We're a DAO that builds tools for building DAOs. (Yes, we used DAO DAO to build DAO DAO).

## Why DAOs?

DAOs are programmable organizations with easliy inspectible states. With liquid
governance tokens, DAOs can produce incentive structures of any level of
complexity&mdash;from giving a grant to a promising artist to creating a welfare
system to your entire community.

Any kind of institution can be represented as a DAO. You can launch a business
or an investment group, found a school, or create a popular assembly for your
local community. The only limit is your ability to organize.

## Why DAO DAO?

DAO DAO helps you build DAOs with a visual interface. We provide a UI for
creating, deploying, voting, and joining DAOs. Through the power of [IBC](https://ibcprotocol.org/), the tokens you launch with DAO DAO can be shared across blockchains. That means you can list your DAO's token on [Osmosis](https://osmosis.zone/). IBC also allows your DAO to hold tokens from other chains. That means your DAO's treasury can hold [Stargaze](https://stargaze.zone) NFTs, or launch decentralized apps with [Akash](https://akash.network/) tokens.


## Where do I begin?

If you just want to get started building a DAO, check out our [Quickstart](/quickstart/create-a-dao.md) guide.

If you're new to the world of DAOs, continue on to learn more.

If you want to understand more about IBC, DAOs, and how all of these pieces fit together, see [What does DAO DAO do?](/docs/more-info/what-does-dao-dao-do)
