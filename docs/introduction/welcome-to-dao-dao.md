# Welcome to DAO DAO!

We're a DAO that builds tools for building DAOs. (Yes, we used DAO DAO to build DAO DAO).

## Why DAOs?
DAOs are programmable organizations with easliy-inspectible states. With liquid
governance tokens, DAOs can produce incentive structures of any level of
complexity&mdash;from giving a grant to a promising artist to creating a welfare
system to your entire community.

Any kind of institution can be represented as a DAO. You can launch a business
or an investment group, found a school, or create a popular assembly for your
local community. The only limit is your ability to organize.

## Why DAO DAO?
DAO DAO helps you build DAOs with a visual interface. We provide a UI for
creating, deploying, voting, and joining DAOs. Through the power of IBC, DAO DAO
will help you launch a governance token in the interchain.


## Where do I begin?
