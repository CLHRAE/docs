# Welcome to DAO DAO

[DAO DAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno10h0hc64jv006rr8qy0zhlu4jsxct8qwa0vtaleayh0ujz0zynf2s2r7v8q) is a
DAO
that builds DAOs. We build powerful, [open
source](https://github.com/DA0-DA0), DAO tooling.

## Why DAOs?

DAOs are programmable organizations with easily inspectable
states. DAOs can help govern everything from an [Internet community of
dogs](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1czh5dy2kxwwt5hlw6rr2q25clj96sheftsdccswg9qe34m3wzgdswmw8ju)
to the [development funds of entire
blockchains](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1gpwekludv6vu8pkpnp2hwwf7f84a7mcvgm9t2cvp92hvpxk07kdq8z4xj2).

Because DAO DAO DAOs operate on a blockchain, they are
transparent by default. This means that votes, the voting power of
members, and actions a DAO takes are all publicly auditable. This can
help provide trust that DAO members are being good stewards of their
communities.

The programmability of DAOs makes them extremely flexible. DAO DAO is
designed as a set of [composable
components](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/wiki/DAO-DAO-Contracts-Design)
that can snap together like Lego blocks. Communities can pick and 
choose pre-built governance components to build a system that works
well for them, or they can program their own.

Any kind of institution can be represented as a DAO. You can launch a
business or an investment group, found a school, or create a popular
assembly for your local community. Our hope is to build a platform
where the challenges of community formation are social, not
bureaucratic.

## Why DAO DAO?

DAO DAO helps you build and operate DAOs with a visual
interface. Usability and accessibility are a priority. Technical and
non-technical communities alike have a space here.

DAOs on DAO DAO do everything from helping run
[blockchains](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1gpwekludv6vu8pkpnp2hwwf7f84a7mcvgm9t2cvp92hvpxk07kdq8z4xj2)
and [decentralized exchanges](https://www.rawdao.zone/) to building
communities of people who [like
dogs](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1czh5dy2kxwwt5hlw6rr2q25clj96sheftsdccswg9qe34m3wzgdswmw8ju).

DAO DAO DAOs are [IBC](https://www.coinbase.com/cloud/discover/dev-foundations/ibc-protocol) enabled. This means
that your DAO on [Juno](https://junonetwork.io) can manage protocols
and hold assets on any IBC-enabled chain.

[Quickstart](/quickstart/create-a-dao.md) guide.

pieces fit together, see [What does DAO DAO
do?](/docs/more-info/what-does-dao-dao-do.md)
