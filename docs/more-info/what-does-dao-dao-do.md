# What does DAO DAO do?

As described in the [introduction](introduction/welcome-to-dao-dao), DAO DAO is a tool for building DAOs.

Now, here's the fully-jargoned explanation. DAO DAO is a tool for building multi-chain DAOs: DAOs whose treasuries can hold any IBC-supporting token, and DAOs whose tokens can be transferred to any IBC-supporting chain. DAO DAO is deployed on the [Juno network](https://www.junonetwork.io/), a smart contracting platform built around [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/). DAO DAO's contracts are written in Rust. DAO DAO provides these contracts and a UI for managing them.

## Sorry, what?
